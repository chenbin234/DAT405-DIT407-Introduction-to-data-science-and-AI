In a sequential decision process, the process jumps between different states (the environment), and in each state the decision maker, or agent, chooses among a set of actions.

At each jump the decision maker receives a reward, and the objective is to find a sequence of decisions (or an optimal policy) that maximizes the accumulated rewards.\n",

    "The problem of **decision making under uncertainty** (commonly known as **reinforcement learning**) can be broken down into\n",
    "two parts. First, how do we learn about the world? This involves both the\n",
    "problem of modeling our initial uncertainty about the world, and that of drawing conclusions from evidence and our initial belief. Secondly, given what we\n",
    "currently know about the world, how should we decide what to do, taking into\n",
    "account future events and observations that may change our conclusions?\n",
    "Typically, this will involve creating long-term plans covering possible future\n",
    "eventualities. That is, when planning under uncertainty, we also need to take\n",
    "into account what possible future knowledge could be generated when implementing our plans. Intuitively, executing plans which involve trying out new\n",
    "things should give more information, but it is hard to tell whether this information will be beneficial. The choice between doing something which is already\n",
    "known to produce good results and experiment with something new is known\n",
    "as the **exploration-exploitation dilemma**.\n",

    "Consider the problem of selecting a restaurant to go to during a vacation. Lets say the\n",

    "### Markov Decision Processes\n",
    "Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making under uncertainty. An *agent* moves between *states* in a *state space* choosing *actions* that affects the transition probabilities between states, and the subsequent *rewards* recieved after a jump. This is then repeated a finite or infinite number of epochs. The objective, or the *solution* of the MDP, is to optimize the accumulated rewards of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an MDP consists of five parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision epochs: $t={1,2,...,T}$, where $T\\leq \\infty$\n",
    "* State space: $S=\\{s_1,s_2,...,s_N\\}$ of the underlying environment\n",
    "* Action space $A=\\{a_1,a_2,...,a_K\\}$ available to the decision maker at each decision epoch\n",
    "* Transition probabilities $p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$ for jumping from state $s_t$ to state $s_{t+1}$ after taking action $a_t$\n",
    "* Reward functions $R_t = r(a_t,s_t,s_{t+1})$ resulting from the chosen action and subsequent transition\n",
    "\n",
    "A *decision policy* is a function $\\pi: s \\rightarrow a$, that gives instructions on what action to choose in each state. A policy can either be *deterministic*, meaning that the action is given for each state, or *randomized* meaning that there is a probability distribution over the set of possible actions for each state. Given a specific policy $\\pi$ we can then compute the the *expected total reward* when starting in a given state $s_1 \\in S$, which is also known as the *value* for that state, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$V^\\pi (s_1) = E\\left[ \\sum_{t=1}^{T} r(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1}) {\\Large |} s_1\\right] = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} r(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1}) p(s_{t+1} | a_t,s_t)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $a_t = \\pi(s_t)$. To ensure convergence and to control how much credit to give to future rewards, it is common to introduce a *discount factor* $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$. For instance, if we think all future rewards should count equally, we would use $\\gamma = 1$, while if we value near-future rewards higher than more distant rewards, we would use $\\gamma < 1$. The expected total *discounted* reward then becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V^\\pi( s_1) = \\sum_{t=1}^T \\gamma^{t-1} r(s_t,a_t, s_{t+1}) p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to find the *optimal* policy we want to find the policy $\\pi^*$ that gives the highest total reward $V^*(s)$ for all $s\\in S$. That is, we want to find the policy where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V^*(s) \\geq V^\\pi(s), s\\in S$$\n",

    "To solve this we use a dynamic programming equation called the *Bellman equation*, given by\n",

    "\n",
    "It can be shown that if $\\pi$ is a policy such that $V^\\pi$ fulfills the Bellman equation, then $\\pi$ is an optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A real world example would be an inventory control system. The states could be the amount of items we have in stock, and the actions would be the amount of items to order at the end of each month. The discrete time would be each month and the reward would be the profit. \n"

    "For larger problems we need to utilize algorithms to determine the optimal policy $\\pi^*$. *Value iteration* is one such algorithm that iteratively computes the value for each state. Recall that for a policy to be optimal, it must satisfy the Bellman equation above, meaning that plugging in a given candidate $V^*$ in the right-hand side (RHS) of the Bellman equation should result in the same $V^*$ on the left-hand side (LHS). This property will form the basis of our algorithm. Essentially, it can be shown that repeated application of the RHS to any intial value function $V^0(s)$ will eventually lead to the value $V$ which statifies the Bellman equation. Hence repeated application of the Bellman equation will also lead to the optimal value function. We can then extract the optimal policy by simply noting what actions that satisfy the equation.    "

In each time step *t* the agent chooses an action *a* based on the current state *s*, observes the reward *r* and the next state *s'*, and repeats the process in the new state. Q-learning is then a method that allows the agent to act optimally. Here we will focus on the simplest form of Q-learning algorithms, which can be applied when all states are known to the agent, and the state and action spaces are reasonably small. This simple algorithm uses a table of Q-values for each $(s,a)$ pair, which is then updated in each time step using the update rule in step $k+1$\n",
